###  Overview

In today's digital age, misinformation spreads rapidly across social media and news platforms, making it challenging to discern fact from fiction. "TruthGuard" is an intelligent system designed to automatically identify and flag fake news articles using advanced machine learning techniques. By analyzing the content, structure, and language of news pieces, TruthGuard aims to empower users to make informed decisions and promote media literacy.

###  How It Works

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   We gather a diverse dataset of news articles, both real and fake, from reputable sources. The data undergoes cleaning and preprocessing to remove noise, irrelevant information, and standardize formats.I have used a dataset from Kaggle in my Project.

2. **Feature Extraction**
   Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like TF-IDF and sentiment analysis, we extract meaningful features from the text. These features help the model understand the context, tone, and intent behind the news articles.

3. **Model Training**
   Various machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), NaÃ¯ve Bayes, and neural networks, are trained on the processed data. Ensemble methods are employed to enhance accuracy and robustness.

4. **Evaluation & Optimization**
   The model's performance is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Continuous tuning and validation ensure the system's reliability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

* **Automate Fake News Detection**: Develop a system that can swiftly and accurately identify fake news articles.
* **Enhance Public Awareness**: Provide users with tools to verify the authenticity of news content.
* **Support Fact-Checkers**: Assist journalists and fact-checking organizations in combating misinformation.([OSF][1])
